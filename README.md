# SQL-ASSIGNMEN
In this SQL assignment, we set up a database for a record company. We created tables for bands, albums, and songs, and then filled them with data.
We used different operations using SQL queries:


1.Create Table: The bands, albums, and songs tables were created with the necessary information and connections between them.
                      We added details about bands, albums, and songs to the tables.


2.Queries:
  We wrote a query to find the names of all bands from the songs table, making sure each band's name is different.
  Found the oldest album by looking at the release years.
 Separated bands with albums from those without albums.
 Identified the longest album.
Inserted a record for a favorite band and one of their albums.
Calculated the average length of all songs.
Found the longest song for each album.
Counted the number of songs for each band.
Created a decade column in the albums table to represent when an album was released.
Filtered albums that start with the word 'The'.
Selected albums released between 2008 and 2013.


3.Conclusion:-
  This assignment covered a variety of SQL tasks including setting up tables, adding and deleting data and performing queries to get useful information    from the data.
